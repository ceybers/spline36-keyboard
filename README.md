## 📻 Project Description

The Spline36 is a 36-key ergonomic split keyboard. 

The columns are staggered, slightly splayed or fanned out, and there is an angle to the top and bottom row to create a key-well effect. Similarly the thumb cluster is offset and angled to fit under the thumb in a more natural position.

Beneath the plate, all the keys are connected directly (no diodes) to a RP2040 based MCU with a USB-C connector. The two halves are connected via TRRS. The bottom plate is fastened via M2 screws and heatset inserts.
